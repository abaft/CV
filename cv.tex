\section*{Personal Profile}
Enthusiastic and technically minded individual who enjoys a challenge and revels in solving problems.
Hard working with a persistent desire to learn and understand.
Currently in first year studying toward a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Leeds.

\section*{Core Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grounding mathematics providing a robust structure to think about and model problems.

\item Practical problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking abilities.

\item Communication skills and ability to work cohesively within a team.

\item An ability to quickly adapt myself to new environments and learn new skills efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evidencing Experience}
\paragraph{Young Enterprise}
In my senior school years I was involved in young enterprise, a scheme in which high school students are encouraged to set up a small business.
This taught me valuable teem working skills requiring me to chair and contend with teams in meetings and work.
In addition to this I created and administrated an e-commerce platform in order to sell our products online.

\paragraph{ICREW Base}
ICREW run a competition every year in which around 500 schools participate in a accounting competition.
I was selected to participate in this competition, and our team won the regional heats proceeding to come within the top 8 at the national finals.
This shows an aptitude for contextual problem solving and thinking on ones feet.

\paragraph{Computing}
In addition to my course I have also participated in various coding and technology competitions.
For example, Sky ran a coding event at their Osterley in which my team won with a real time emotion recognition software, created in just 5 hours.
This shows an ability to work hard, quickly and efficiently think on our feet, as well as an ability to work really well as a team.

\paragraph{University Societies}
I have taken an active role organising and administrating society events at university.
For example, we, through compsoc, have organised multiple coding events and a plethora socials.
