\section*{Past Experience}
\textit{I have never had a job so any and all experience listed here was done `for love' in addition to my academic studies}

\paragraph{Micro Controllers} In an attempt to understand how computers worked at a lower level I investigated micro controllers.
I developed a radio GPS tracker device using the ATmega328P AVR microcontroller.
This taught me a lot about assembler and interfaces such as I2C and serial.

\paragraph{Radio} I got into amateur radio a few years ago to experiment with digital data transmission modes and packet radio.
This led to an interest in computer networking (TCP/IP and UCP/IP).

\paragraph{Web Development} In high school I was a member of a `Young Enterprise' team.
I was given the task to develop an e-commerce platform to sell our products.
Through this I worked with PHP, mySQL, AJAX, nginx, apache, linux ect
and I interacted with the Pay Pal API to take payments.
This `Young Enterprise' experience, along with ICAEW's BASE competition taught me a lot about business and management.

\paragraph{Programming/Linux} I have spent time investigating many programming languages and their various optimisations and use cases.
I mostly write my projects in low level languages like C++, enjoying the direct control I have over the machine code generated.
I have used linux as my primary OS for some time now and love free software and the control I have over it.
In my time I have also set up many servers using Linux as well as FreeBSD for things from storage servers to chat bots.
