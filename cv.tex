\section*{Personal Profile}
Enthusiastic and technically minded individual who enjoys a challenge and revels in solving problems.
Hard working with a persistent desire to learn and understand.
Currently in first year studying toward a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Leeds.

\section*{Core Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grounding in mathematics providing a robust structure to think about and model problems.

\item Practical problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking abilities.

\item Communication skills and ability to work cohesively within a team.

\item An ability to quickly adapt myself to new environments and learn new skills efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evidencing Experience}
\paragraph{Young Enterprise}
In my senior school years I was involved in young enterprise, a scheme in which high school students are encouraged to set up a small business.
This taught me valuable team working skills; requiring me to chair meetings and direct small teams.
In addition, I created and maintained an e-commerce platform in order to sell our products online.

\paragraph{Web Development}
I was commissioned to create a website for I x E LTD.
This company no longer exists but sold `hover boards' through the website.
The website saw significant traffic and facilitated a substantial number of sales for the business.

\paragraph{ICREW Base}
ICREW run an annual event which, in 2017, saw around 500 schools competing in an accounting competition.
I was selected by my school to participate, and our team won the regional heats, then came within the top 8 at the national finals.
This shows an aptitude for contextual problem solving and thinking on ones feet.

\paragraph{Computing}
In addition to my course I have also participated in various coding and technology competitions.
For example: Sky ran a coding event at their Osterley campus in which my team won with a facial emotion tracking app, created in just 5 hours.
This shows an ability to work hard, quickly and efficiently, thinking on our feet, as well as an ability to work in a effective coordinated manner.

\paragraph{University Societies}
I have taken an active role organising and administrating society events at my University.
For example, we, through the computer society, have organised multiple coding events, working with companies like google, and a plethora of entertaining socials.

I am the secretary of our rifle society, through which we run weekly sports shooting events.

\paragraph{Electronics}
I am an avid electronics hobbyist, capable of electronic construction with SMDs and through hole components;
able to use hot air stations and soldering irons, as well as CAD software for PCB design.
