\section*{Personal Profile}
Enthusiastic and technically minded individual who enjoys a challenge and revels in solving problems.
Hard working with a persistent desire to learn and understand.
Currently in first year studying toward a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Leeds.

\section*{Core Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grounding mathematics providing a robust structure to think about and model problems.

\item Practical problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking abilities.

\item Communication skills and ability to work cohesively within a team.

\item An ability to quickly adapt myself to new environments and learn new skills efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Past Experience}
\textit{Experience listed here was done `for love' in addition to my academic studies}

\paragraph{Micro Controllers} In an attempt to track a meteorological balloon going into space I investigated micro controllers.
I developed a interrupt driven RTTY radio GPS tracker device using the megaAVR microcontroller.
This taught me about assembler and interfaces such as I$^2$C, UART and SPI;
as well as elements computer architecture as enforced by my computer science course.
It also stretched my programming abilities, to work with the very limited microcontroller in terms of RAM and PROM space.

\paragraph{Radio} I got into amateur radio a few years ago (attaining the full licence) to experiment with digital data transmission modes and packet radio.
This led to a wider interest in computer networking (TCP/IP and UCP/IP).
I enjoy working with almost all communications protocols and encryption.

\paragraph{Web Development} In senior school I was a member of a `Young Enterprise' team.
I was tasked to develop an e-commerce platform to sell our products.
Through this I worked with PHP, mySQL, AJAX, nginx, apache, linux ect
and I interacted with the Pay Pal API to take payments.
This `Young Enterprise' experience, along with ICAEW's BASE competition (the team I was in came in the top 8 of 500 nation wide) taught me about business and management providing valuable team working skills.

\paragraph{Programming/Linux} 
I mostly write my projects in low level languages like C, enjoying the near direct control I have over the machine code generated.
I have used linux as my primary OS for some time now and love free software and the control I have over it.
I have configured many servers using Linux as well as FreeBSD with applications from storage servers to chat bots.
