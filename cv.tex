\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{p{2cm} p{6cm}}
  \textbf{C/C++}&Good knowledge of the C/C++ programming language, as well as object oriented design (in C++) and an ability to catch on fast to any C like programming language.\\[.1cm]
  \textbf{HTML5, CSS3, PHP, mySQL, Javascript}&Ability to create and style websites using CSS3 and HTML5, also used sass. Good understanding of DOM and how it works and how to manipulate it with javasript and jquery.
  Experienced in using PHP and AJAX to create web apps.\\[.1cm]
  \textbf{Python}&my go to scripting language, Good python coding ability\\[.1cm]
  \textbf{Misc.}&I enjoy playing with languages, so here are a few odd ones.
  Bash scripting, to use linux effectively.
  GoLang, interesting language with it's gorutines and syntactical idiosyncrasies.
  Verilog, a hardware definition language, provides a different way to think about problems.
  Rust, interesting notion of ownership.
  \LaTeX\ The type up language of the gods, write almost all documents in it.
  R, for data analytics in A level science projects.

\section*{Personal Profile}
Enthusiastic and technically minded individual who enjoys a challenge and revels in solving problems.
Hard working with a respect for authority and persistent desire to learn and understand.
Currently in first year studying toward a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Leeds.

\section*{Core Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grounding mathematics providing a robust structure to thing about and model problems.

\item Practical problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking abilities.

\item Communication skills and ability to work cohesively within a team.

\item An ability to quickly adapt myself to new environments and learn new skills efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Past Experience}
\textit{Experience listed here was done `for love' in addition to my academic studies}

\paragraph{Micro Controllers} In an attempt to understand how computers worked at a lower level I investigated micro controllers.
I developed a radio GPS tracker device using the ATmega328P AVR microcontroller.
This taught me a lot about assembler and interfaces such as I2C, UART and SPI.
The project then lead to further embedded computing experience with all sorts of real time microcontrollers, coded in either C or Assembler.
\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\paragraph{Radio} I got into amateur radio a few years ago to experiment with digital data transmission modes and packet radio.
This led to an interest in computer networking (TCP/IP and UCP/IP).
I enjoy working with communications protocols and encryption.
\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\paragraph{Web Development} In high school I was a member of a `Young Enterprise' team.
I was given the task to develop an e-commerce platform to sell our products.
Through this I worked with PHP, mySQL, AJAX, nginx, apache, linux ect
and I interacted with the Pay Pal API to take payments.
This `Young Enterprise' experience, along with ICAEW's BASE competition taught me a lot about business and management.
\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\paragraph{Programming/Linux} I have spent time investigating many programming languages and their various optimisations and use cases.
I mostly write my projects in low level languages like C, enjoying the near direct control I have over the machine code generated.
I have used linux as my primary OS for some time now and love free software and the control I have over it.
In my time I have also set up many servers using Linux as well as FreeBSD for things from storage servers to chat bots.
